# Fractured-Minds.asl
LiveSplit autosplitter for [Fractured Minds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/688740/Fractured_Minds/) specifically made with the faster Amazon Prime+ version I made available in the Speedrun.com resources for the game [here](https://www.speedrun.com/fracturedminds/resources). **Any other version _will not_ work**

## Features:
- Load removal for loadzone inbetween chapters (Couple of ms save, includes WJ now*)
- Pausing the game also pauses the timer
- Additional Optional splits (Hallway and Water Jump)
- Pause timer on game crash/ close (Now also optionally resets on close by default)
- Ability to split on win for any%x10 (Disables menu reset as well as pause buffering timer. Load removal will still work.)

Timer starts on any movement inside chapter one (Walking / moving camera) and ends when you lose control in chapter six
